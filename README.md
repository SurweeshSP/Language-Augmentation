# Language Augmentation

# 🧠 Language Augmentation — Sravam-Based Architecture for Hindi & Telugu Semantic Similarity


## 📘 Overview
**Language Augmentation** is a Machine Learning project that focuses on identifying and retrieving **semantically similar sentences** in **Hindi** and **Telugu**, moving beyond traditional keyword-based approaches.  
The project introduces **Sravam**, a *Transformer-based architecture* optimized for **low-resource languages**, capable of understanding meaning and context to enhance **information retrieval** and **cross-lingual understanding**.

---

## 🚀 Objective
To develop a **semantic retrieval system** that takes a user-provided sentence in Hindi or Telugu and returns **contextually similar sentences** using transformer-based embeddings.

### Applications:
- Customer Support Automation  
- Content Recommendation Systems  
- Knowledge Base Navigation  
- Multilingual Search Systems

## 🏗️ Proposed Solution — The Sravam Architecture
**Sravam** is an **encoder-only Transformer model** designed for efficiency and multilingual semantic understanding.  
It integrates modern innovations such as **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** and **SwiGLU activations** to enhance performance while maintaining scalability.

### 🔹 Key Architectural Features
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Shared Multilingual Embedding Layer** | Unified semantic space for Hindi and Telugu tokens for improved cross-lingual mapping. |
| **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** | Improves generalization for long text sequences and positional understanding. |
| **SwiGLU Activation Function** | Replaces ReLU with gated linear units to enhance information flow and efficiency. |
| **LoRA Adaptor (Low-Rank Adaptation)** | Enables fine-tuning large models without retraining all parameters, improving speed and efficiency. |

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

### 🧩 Model Summary
| Metric | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Total Parameters** | 19,595,415 |
| **Trainable Parameters** | 19,595,415 |
| **Non-trainable Parameters** | 0 |
| **Model Size** | ~74.75 MB |

The model is trained using an encoder-only transformer with:
- **Hidden Size:** 512  
- **Number of Layers:** 6  
- **Attention Heads:** 8  

A **prototype version (~5.5M parameters)** was implemented for testing, while the full-scale **1.7B parameter model** is planned for production deployment.

## 🧠 Model Components
- **Tokenizer:** SentencePiece/BPE tokenizer trained on a Hindi–Telugu corpus.  
- **Vector Index:** Uses **Faiss** or **Pinecone** for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) searches.  
- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine Similarity for semantic comparison between embeddings.  

---

## 📊 Advantages
✅ **High Performance:** Transformer optimizations (RoPE, SwiGLU) ensure strong semantic representation.  
✅ **Cross-Lingual Understanding:** Shared embeddings enable smooth translation of meaning across Hindi and Telugu.  
✅ **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** LoRA adaptors allow lightweight domain-specific retraining.  
✅ **Scalable Design:** Prototype can scale from 5M to 1.7B parameters with minimal re-engineering.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
| Enhancement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **LoRA Integration** | Integrate LoRA fully for lightweight fine-tuning on new datasets. |
| **Generative Data Augmentation** | Use the model for paraphrasing and synthetic data generation. |
| **Knowledge Distillation** | Create a compact “student” model (≈750M parameters) for efficient deployment. |
| **Full 1.7B Scale Training** | Train the complete architecture on a large, diverse multilingual corpus. |
